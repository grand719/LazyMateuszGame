# Procrastin Intern
## Introduction: 
Welcome to your first day as an intern at a very "chill" company! Your job is simple: work hard...ish. Keep that WorkingScore up by typing away at the computer, but don't forget to sneak off for some well-deserved slacking. Whether it's scrolling your phone on the toilet, catching a quick nap in the storage room, or grabbing a snack from the kitchen, every moment counts. But bewareâ€”the boss is always lurking, ready to catch you in the act! Can you balance productivity and procrastination without losing your job? Time to show them what a lazy intern can really do!
